                <h2>What Just Happened?</h2>
                <p>Your workstation was left unattended and unlocked. In that time, an unauthorised USB device was connected to your computer and executed code without your knowledge or consent.</p>
                <p>This page was opened automatically through a script injected by that device.</p>
                <p><strong>If this had been a real attack:</strong> An attacker could have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Installed malware or ransomware</li>
                    <li>Stolen sensitive data and credentials</li>
                    <li>Established persistent remote access to your system</li>
                    <li>Gained access to network resources using your credentials</li>
                    <li>Compromised not just your system, but potentially the entire organization</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>This Is Only A Test</h2>
                <p>Don't worry - no harm has been done to your system. This is part of a security awareness exercise conducted by your organisation's security team.</p>
                <p><strong>However, this demonstration illustrates a real vulnerability:</strong></p>
                <p>It took less than 10 seconds to execute this script after finding your unattended workstation. A real attacker would have had the same opportunity.</p>
                <p>Your IT Security team will be in contact with you shortly to discuss this demonstration and provide additional security training.</p>

            <h2>Security Best Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Always lock your computer</strong> when stepping away, even for a moment (Windows key + L)</li>
                <li><strong>Be suspicious of unknown USB devices</strong> and never insert unknown drives into your computer</li>
                <li><strong>Report security incidents immediately</strong> to your security team</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain awareness</strong> of your physical surroundings and who has access to your workspace</li>
